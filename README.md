# metis-project-4
My fourth project as part of the Metis data science bootcamp.

## Goal
In order to examine the national conversation about COVID-19, and to see if this conversation could be mapped to regional trends in case numbers, I performed natural language processing and linear regression on a dataset of over 500,000 tweets. 

## Data Sources
- Twitter
- [COVID Act Now API](https://covidactnow.org/data-api)

## Tools
- Twint
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TextBlob
- Gensim
- Pickle
- Plotly
- IBM Tone Analyzer

## Results
Topic modeling showed the emergence of three general categories: political content, statistical content, and content related to vaccination and treatment information. Sentiment analysis was unable to act as a predictive feature when it came to case density (19% variation explained).
